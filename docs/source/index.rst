Welcome to django-data-migration's documentation!
=================================================

``django-data-migration`` is a reusable Django app that migrates your legacy
data into your new django app. The only thing you have to supply is an
appropriate SQL query that transforms your data fromthe old schema into your
model structure. Dependencies between these migrations will be resolved
automatically. Give it a try!
